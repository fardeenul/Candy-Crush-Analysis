# Candy-Crush-Analysis

In this data analysis project, I aimed to explore and analyze the difficulty levels of a game using R. I started by importing the data from various sources, including CSV and Excel files, using the appropriate R functions. After loading the data, I conducted data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and converting data types to ensure data quality.

Next, I performed an exploratory data analysis to gain an overview of the distribution of level difficulties and player success rates. I used various visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and line plots to identify patterns and trends in the data.

To gain deeper insights, I conducted statistical experiments and hypothesis testing. I utilized linear regression to model the relationship between different variables and used correlation analysis to identify possible dependencies. Additionally, I applied t-tests and ANOVA to compare the difficulty of different levels and evaluate significant differences.

With the results obtained from the statistical analysis, I created informative visualizations, such as line plots with error bars to represent uncertainty in level difficulties. I also added points to highlight each data point and a horizontal dashed line to indicate a specific difficulty threshold. These visualizations helped me interpret the data and draw meaningful conclusions.

In response to a level designer's question, I calculated the probability of an average player completing every level in one attempt. This probability was used to determine if the designer should worry about players easily completing the episode.

The GitHub repository contains all the code I used for data importing, cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. The README file provides a detailed explanation of the project's objectives, methodology, and key findings.
